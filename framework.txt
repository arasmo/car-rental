Pre-defined structure:
Frameworks provide a basic structure or architecture for a specific type of application (e.g., web applications, mobile apps).
Foundation for development:
They offer a starting point for building software, rather than starting from scratch.
Reusable components:
Frameworks include pre-built code modules, libraries, and APIs that can be reused in different parts of the application.
Streamlined development:
By providing pre-built components and tools, frameworks simplify and speed up the development process. 
Focus on unique aspects:
Developers can focus on the specific features and functionalities of their project, rather than spending time on common tasks that are already handled by the framework.
Consistency and standardization:
Frameworks promote consistency in code structure and design, making it easier to maintain and collaborate on projects. 
Different types of frameworks:
There are various frameworks for different purposes, including web development (front-end, back-end), mobile development, data science, and game development.
Examples:
Popular frameworks include Ruby on Rails (web development), React (front-end web development), and Spring (Java development).
